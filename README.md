# Manifesto for Privacy in Software Development

We are seeing that the ubiquitous presence of software has had the side effect of eroding what many consider to be reasonable privacy expectations for users.

We have struggled ourselves with tradeoffs around 
privacy and security. 

We have observed that privacy regulations
have neither protected users in practice nor improved

Through these struggles, we have come to value users and 
privacy and seek to make user's 

## Values

- User privacy over time to market
- 

## Principles

- We do not communicate with users except 
- We do not collect information we do not need to provide the service they specifically signed up for with our service
- We explicitly tell users about the information we do collect
- We do not use third party software that leaks information about users and is then sold
- Technologists inherently play a guiding role in thinking about privacy because we are uniquely positioned to understand where and how user information is collected, sold, etc.
