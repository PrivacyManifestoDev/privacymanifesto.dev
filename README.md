# Manifesto for Privacy in Software Development

We are seeing that the ubiquitous presence of software 
and technology has had the 
side effect of eroding what many consider to be 
reasonable privacy expectations for users.

We have struggled ourselves with tradeoffs around 
privacy and security. 

We have observed that privacy regulations
have neither protected users in practice nor improved
the technical landscape of information collected.

Through these struggles, we have come to value users, 
privacy and security and seek to make user's default
experience aligned to what they would actually expect.

## Values

- User privacy over time to market
- Simplicity and transparency over exhaustive, detailed contracts

## Principles

- We do not collect information we do not need to provide the service users specifically signed up for with our service
- We explicitly tell users about the information we do collect
- We do not use third party software that leaks information about users and/or sell information about users
- Technologists inherently play a guiding role in thinking about privacy because we are uniquely positioned to understand where and how user information is collected, sold, etc.
- Users are smart and may elect to forego privacy considerations when they are laid out clearly
